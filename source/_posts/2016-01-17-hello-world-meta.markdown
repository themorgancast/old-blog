Alright, so this is post number one. I'm keeping as a reminder I should not throw away things with the kind of disregard I often have for something I feel is beneath my skill sets.

So. Post one. I'm using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which is great. I managed to stumble around and spin this up in about an hour, and that was after tearing it down twice to rebuild, and also looking at other blogging engines.

__Stuff I learned:__   
Follow directions for setup. Don't just go in all willy-nilly and expect shit to work.   
Github Pages is actually a pretty great thing.

__Breaking away to:__   
Make homemade pad thai  
Set up scaffolding on a side project  
Be frightened at the price of car parts I need for the 335xi  
Not give two flying fucks about sportsball
